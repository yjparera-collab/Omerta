The AI engineer's trajectory involved developing the Omerta War Intelligence Dashboard, addressing several critical data display and functionality issues. Initially, the focus was on -based data retrieval, correcting sorting in , and resolving  or  values for player stats. This led to deep debugging of data flow, where Cloudflare protection was identified as a major hurdle for the scraping service.

The engineer introduced a hybrid solution: a container-based mock service for development and a Windows-based service for real data (requiring manual CAPTCHA solving). Key technical challenges included MongoDB index conflicts,  for  files, and  dependency issues. A significant race condition was discovered where the list worker overwrote detailed player data, leading to a smart merge implementation. Finally, the engineer tackled UI instability caused by real-time WebSocket updates, proposing batched updates, and implementing untrack players and position range filters, alongside starting work on dynamic scraping intervals and parallel browser tabs.

The Omerta War Intelligence Dashboard aims to provide real-time tactical intelligence from Barafranca.com. Key features include an Analyst for plating drops, a Detective Agency for deep scans (kills/bullets, profiles) on ~100 targets, Cloudflare bypass, MongoDB caching, and WebSockets. The frontend needs a Player Dashboard () with client-side filters (name, family, rank, dead), custom sorting (Position, Rank, Kills, Shots, Wealth, Plating), and a Target Configuration Center () for .

Initial issues included incorrect Rank sorting, and Plating showing unknown with Kills, Shots, Wealth as N/A due to missing  in API responses and data wrapper parsing. This led to a refactor to use  as the primary key. Environment issues (trailing space in , missing  files,  errors) were resolved. Subsequent feature requests included adding untrack players functionality, a Position From/To range filter, and the ability to configure List Worker and Detail Worker refresh intervals and enable parallel scraping via UI.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application for API requests and WebSocket.
    -   **Changes**: New internal  (for scraper notifications),  (proxy to scraper),  (untrack players),  (save UI settings). Player and tracked player endpoints were modified to fetch directly from MongoDB using  as the key.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Primary Flask-based scraping service for Windows, scrapes Barafranca.com, caches into MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   ****: Uses  as the primary key.
        -   **Detail Worker**: Logic to unwrap  wrapper, resolves  from . WebSocket updates were refactored to batched notifications after a scraping cycle. Implemented parallel browser tabs for scraping.
        -   **List Worker**: Improved parsing for  wrapper; critical change for smart merge to prevent overwriting detailed player data (kills, wealth) with general list data, and to selectively update common fields like rank/position. Debugging output was significantly cleaned up. Dynamic intervals based on UI settings implemented.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: React component for displaying player table.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected Rank sorting. Adapted to -keyed detail cache. Modified  to correctly unwrap . Added untrack buttons (+/- icons). Implemented Position From/To range filter inputs and logic.

<pending_tasks>
-   The implementation of the Settings UI, backend API for settings, dynamic intervals in the scraping service, and parallel browser tabs for the detail worker are in progress and need to be tested.
-   User still needs to verify that the dynamic intervals and parallel scraping functionality work as expected and that the UI settings persist.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing dynamic control over the scraping service's behavior through the frontend UI. This involved creating a new  component for the React frontend, which allows the user to configure refresh intervals for the List Worker and Detail Worker, as well as specify the number of parallel browser tabs for the Detail Worker.

On the backend, an API endpoint () was being developed to receive these settings from the frontend. The scraping service () was then being modified to dynamically read and apply these interval settings and to utilize multiple browser tabs for parallel scraping, specifically for the Detail Worker. The overall goal is to provide the user with more granular control over the application's scraping intensity and efficiency, adapting to different phases of the Omerta game. The final step of this implementation, UPDATE MAIN EXECUTION, was just about to be completed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Complete the integration of parallel browser tabs and dynamic intervals, then ask the user to test the new Settings UI.

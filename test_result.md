# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

Only 2 players (AlphaPlayer, DeltaPlayer) are tracked, but all 8 non-tracked players show numeric data like 'Kills: 12Shots: 40' instead of 'Kills: N/A Shots: N/A'. API calls to /api/players/{id} are failing with 'Failed to fetch' errors, but players still get data from somewhere else (likely general players list). The computeRowStats function is not properly implementing the N/A fallback logic. ✅ Other aspects working: Tracked players show numeric values correctly, plating visible (including Very High precedence), rank sorting functional, tracked-only filter working."

Wealth levels (Very Rich, Poor, Nouveau Riche) and plating levels (Very High, Low, High, Medium) all showing correctly. Backend data verified: 12 total players, 4 tracked players with accurate combat statistics. Filter functionality working smoothly."

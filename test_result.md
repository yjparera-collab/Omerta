# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

Statistics panel updates correctly (Total: 3, Filtered: 2/3). ✅ Data integration: PASSED - Both test players found with correct combat stats (TestPlayer123: 5 kills, 25 shots; TestPlayer456: 12 kills, 45 shots). ✅ Real-time updates working.

The sorting logic is completely backwards from user requirements."
